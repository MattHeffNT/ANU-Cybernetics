          Hi Cybernetics class , so good to be here and to get to meet you all...my name is Matt Heffernan.
          and I'm coming to you from Larakia country in Darwin, Northern Territory. and I'd like to pay my respects
          to the elders past and present of this country, and the respective countries each of you are on today.

          So, this is what I'll be talking about today with you all. In my culture, it's important to identify yourself
          by your name, who your "mob" are, and where you come from. So that's where I'll be starting.

          I then want to talk a little bit about some of the work that I do at Indigital, and some of the ways in which
          we leverage technology for social and economic good.

          Then I want to talk about my other job as a video game producer at GUCK. And how Indigenous ownership of our
          stories is vital for collaboration.I also want to look at what it means to express culture in subversive ways
          that disrupt the mental models that are developed about how/when we can/and do express.

          Finally, i'll conclude with some other stuff i'm working on, and how it integrates real world AI/robotics as
          it is today, and how it could be imagined in the not too distant future. Mykei the robot dog.

          So my name is Matt I'm a Luritja/Arrernte and German/Irish mix.
          in my language and culture I have a few names. My formal name
          is Ngamurarri after my famous painter uncle "Mick Ngamurarri"
          of the Papunya Tula arts movement. I have a few other names like
          Tjapaltjarri, Kalibabu etc. But you can just call me Matt.

          My family come from around this small remote community
          in central Australia called Papunya or Warumpi and from communities even further west.
          I spent the first few years of my life here.

          I was first exposed to computers through my dad, who had an old laptop
          that was the size of a small brief case.
