            Hi Cybernetics class , so good to be here and to get to meet you
            all...my name is Matt Heffernan. and I'm coming to you from Larakia
            country in Darwin, Northern Territory. and I'd like to pay my
            respects to the elders past and present of this country, and the
            respective countries each of you are on today.

            So, this is what I'll be talking about today with you all. In my
            culture, it's important to identify yourself by your name, who your
            "mob" are, and where you come from. So that's where I'll be
            starting. I then want to talk a little bit about some of the work
            that I do at Indigital, and some of the ways in which we leverage
            technology for social and economic good. Then I want to talk about
            my other job as a video game producer at GUCK. And how Indigenous
            ownership of our stories is vital for collaboration.I also want to
            look at what it means to express culture in subversive ways that
            disrupt the mental models that are developed about how/when we
            can/and do express. Finally, i'll conclude with some other stuff i'm
            working on, and how it integrates real world AI/robotics as it is
            today, and how it could be imagined in the not too distant future.

              My family come from around this small remote community in central
              Australia called Papunya or Warumpi and further west out to
              communities like Mount Leibig, Kintore and Kiwirrkura. I spent the
              first few years of my life here. It is the birthplace of the "dot
              painting" art style and The Warumpi Band (famous for the song My
              Island Home). The area and mob that I come from are the last to
              have had "first contact" with white Australians, with the last
              group of Pintupi in 1984. A bit different to the narrative of
              colonization happening hundreds of years ago right?

            <aside class="notes">
              I was first exposed to computers through my dad, who had an old
              laptop that was the size of a small brief case. I was exposed to
              DOS, Basic and Space Invaders. Growing up, in Alice Springs and
              later in Darwin, my interest in video games grew, so I went about
              learning Basic and C to try and program a text adventure. I did
              some IT in school, but dropped it as an elective because i found
              it boring. However, wasn't until i worked in the NT Government in
              the Dept of Business in the economcis and policy team that I found
              myself leaning on programming again.....for some reason, the
              department at the time, was manually downloading ABS data sheets,
              and manually doing the number crunches which would then be loaded
              into respective graphs and reports for things like the state of
              the states and quarterly business updates blah blah. This process
              would take approximately a week to pull all together. So I went
              about automating this by scraping the ABS website for the
              respective data (in retrospect I should have just used the API), I
              automated the calculations and then automated the populating of
              the graphs. A four day job turned into a 3 minute job with a press
              of a button. This made me realize, I actually enjoyed the coding
              much more than being a public servant. from there I went into an
              IT degree with a software developer specialization, and have had
              the opportunity to work across a variety of interesting projects
              and agencies.

              So I want to talk a little bit about Indigital, and some of the
              ways in which we're using tech to inspire and disrupt the
              education system. I think one of the downsides of western or white
              education is that everything is compartmentalized into their
              respective electives or disciplines etc. Even though this isn't
              necessarily 1. the way the real world works, and 2. The way our
              brain approaches problem solving. Related to this, is the way in
              which "Indigenous things" are taught as ideas, events and moments
              in history. Even though Indigenous people are still here,
              expressing our culture in new and unique ways. Indigital has a few
              different "arms", but our main product is our schools program.
              Firstly, we reach out to the respective traditional owners and
              elders of the area in which the school is.

              We work with teachers and show them how to leverage Minecraft
              Education Edition which has a Python,Javascript and "MakeCode"
              interface. We get students to use coding to print out words in the
              respective Indigenous languages. Or explore the traditional
              Indigenous stories from the area and how they could be imagined
              through these worlds. Depending on the class, this can scale in
              complexity.

              We couple this process with Paint3D or TinkerCAD, where we
              introduce teachers or students to 3d art and modelling. We then
              use our voice recorder app to record the stories or just words in
              Indigenous languages. The MineCraft world, the 3d Models and voice
              reccordings are then all brought together in our mobile

              So the amazing distingusihed Professor Genevieve Bell shared this

              framing and asking the right questions. For me the questions that
              I want to explore is, if we're interrogating what a new branch of
              engineering could look like, does this mean a change in the
              individual or a change in the systems? What do you think? How do
              Indigenous epistomologies and ontologies fit into this? Are we
              just recreating the same systems of colonization and environmental
              harm?

                Indigi-Futurism is a subgenre of sci-fi, and like other
                "futurist" fiction can include speculative history and
                speculative fiction.....
              </p>

              <p>
                What seperates it from its literary cousins however is the idea
                that we're living in our post-apocalyptic dystopias future
                now.....it's hard to ignore that after seeing images of the red
                skies from the bush fires not long ago, or when thinking about
                the impact of nuclear testing on Indigenous families in South
                Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
                What fascinates me is...Tjukurrpa or "dreamtime" stories aren't
                just fairy tails or fables....they also served a purpose for our
                survival....with new modes of expressing identity, how do we
                create new tjukurrpa? Do your cultures or sub-cultures (broadlY
                not just ethnic cultures) have storytelling as a means by which
                to express identity, or to share survival information?
              </p>
              <p>
                I like to imagine what this country could look like if we
                started paying attention to the "why" of traditional Indigenous
                engineering systems
              </p>

              <p>
                I also like to question why mental models of Indigenous cultural
                expression have limited us to dot paintings, didgereedoos and
                clap sticks. While these are important, i think these new
                modalities of identity, and tjukurrpa are just as "authentic" as
                the aforementioned objects that are often associated with our
                culture. Imagine if your cultural expression was reduced to the
                object, custom that your culture/s is most famous for?

              So i guess this is where I get to talk about some more of the fun
              things that I have worked on, and that feel cybernetic to
              me....but also i think can be ways in which we as technologist can
              create space for more realistic discussion about AI/Robotics in
              the general public
            </p>
            <p>
              So since last year I've been a mentor with the Australian and New
              Zealand Arts Councils, where digital artists or technologists were
              paired with an artist to help them to migrate their art into
              digital...vauge I know. However, i was paired with the deadly
              Roshelle Fong, and the video is .....well it's for your eyes
              only...and it's a video of our visit to the creature workshop in
              Melbourne...for some research for her MTC commissioned play about
              a super intelligent robot dog that comes to live with a
              interracial couple, one of whom is a technophobe.
            </p>
            <p>
              I actually got to sit in on the first few script readings with
              actors and it was amazing.....as a script/story consultant, there
              was some stupid momnets for me where i was so immersed in the play
              thinking about how realistic the depiction of robotics/AI
              is...then I realized that ooh yeah I can't say that about my own
              stuff haha.
            </p>

            <p>
              The play explores how as AI is steadily increasing in its
              capability to understand the human language, what impact could
              this have on human to human relationships. Is the impact
              necessarily bad?

              and I guess that's a question I would like to put to you if I

              malevolent....while in the real world, we sort of have a black and
              white view (at least in most media) about tech being the enabler
              of utopias or the harbingers of doom. Is there a middle ground
              here? what do you think that looks like? Or one more for your
              noodle.....do we have a responsibility as storytellers in our own
              capacity, to imagine stories and futures for our technologies that
              will benefit humanity?
