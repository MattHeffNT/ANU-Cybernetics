          Note:
          Hi Cybernetics class , so good to be here and to get to meet you all...my name is Matt Heffernan.
          and I'm coming to you from Larakia country in Darwin, Northern Territory. and I'd like to pay my respects
          to the elders past and present of this country, and the respective countries each of you are on today.

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>

          ## What I'll be talking about

          - Who I am 
          - Indigital - what we do, NBE, what it means
          - GUCK - Indigi-Futurism, Future Folklore 
          - Storytelling and Cybernetics 
          - Questions

          <!-- this is where presenter notes go -->
          Note: 
            So, this is what I'll be talking about today with you all. In my culture, it's important to identify yourself by your name, who your "mob" are, and where you come from. So that's where I'll be starting.

            I then want to talk a little bit about some of the work that I do at Indigital, and some of the ways in which we leverage technology for social and economic good.

            Then I want to talk about my other job as a video game producer at GUCK. And how Indigenous ownership of our stories is vital for collaboration.I also want to look at what it means to express culture in subversive ways that disrupt the mental models that are developed about how/when we can/and do express. 

           Finally, i'll conclude with some other stuff i'm working on, and how it integrates real world AI/robotics as it is today, and how it could be imagined in the not too distant future. Mykei the robot dog.
